<div style="text-align: left;">In this post, we will see introduction to web services and some jargons of web
  services.</div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Web service Tutorial Content:</h2>
<br />
Web service is a way of communication that allows interoperability between different applications on different
platforms, for example, a java based application on Windows can communicate with a .Net based one on Linux. The
communication can be done through a set of XML messages over HTTP protocol.
<br />
<br />
Web services are browsers and operating system independent service, which means it can run on any browser without the
need of making any changes. Web Services take Web-applications to the Next Level.
<br />
<br />
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has defined the web services. According to W3C, &#8220;Web Services are the
message-based design frequently found on the Web and in enterprise software. The Web of Services is based on
technologies such as HTTP, XML, SOAP, WSDL, SPARQL, and others.&#8221;

Lets say,you are a java developer and&nbsp; you can publish your functions on internet or lan through java web service
so any other developer(lets say .Net developer) can access your function.
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Why you need to learn web services:</h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  <h4 style="text-align: left;">Reuse already developed(old) functionality into new software:</h4>
  Lets understand with very simple example.Lets say you are developing a finance software for a company on java and you
  have old .net software which manages salary of employees.So rather then developing new software for employee part,you
  can use old software and for other parts like infrastructure you can develop your own functionalities.<br />
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <h4 style="text-align: left;">Usability :</h4>
  </div>
  Web Services allow the business logic of many different systems to be exposed over the Web. This gives your
  applications the freedom to chose the Web Services that they need. Instead of re-inventing the wheel for each client,
  you need only include additional application-specific business logic on the client-side. This allows you to develop
  services and/or client-side code using the languages and tools that you want.<br />
  <h4 style="text-align: left;"></h4>
  <h4 style="text-align: left;">Interoperability :</h4>
  <div style="text-align: left;">This is the most important benefit of Web Services. Web Services typically work
    outside of private networks, offering developers a non-proprietary route to their solutions.Web Services also let
    developers use their preferred programming languages. In addition, thanks to the use of standards-based
    communications methods, Web Services are virtually platform-independent.</div>
  <h4 style="text-align: left;">Loosely Coupled:</h4>
  Each service exists independently of the other services that make up the application. Individual pieces of the
  application to be modified without impacting unrelated areas.<br />
  <h4 style="text-align: left;">Ease of Integration:</h4>
  Data is isolated between applications creating &#8217;silos&#8217;. Web Services act as glue between these and enable
  easier communications within and across organisations.
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Deployability :</h4>
Web Services are deployed over standard Internet technologies. This makes it possible to deploy Web Services even over
the fire wall to servers running on the Internet on the other side of the globe. Also thanks to the use of proven
community standards, underlying security (such as SSL) is already built-in.
<br />
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<br />
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Some jargons used in Web services:</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Simple Object Access Protocol(SOAP):</h4>
<div style="text-align: left;">SOAP is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the
  implementation of Web services in computer networks. It relies on XML as its message format.</div>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
  <b>Web Service Description Language(WSDL)</b>:
</h4>
WSDL stands for Web Service Description Language. It is an XML file that describes
<br />
the technical details of how to implement a web service, more specifically the URI,
<br />
port, method names, arguments, and data types. Since WSDL is XML, it is both
<br />
human-readable and machine-consumable, which aids in the ability to call and bind to
<br />
services dynamically.
<br />
<br />
<b>Elements of WSDL are:</b>
<br />
<br />
<b>Description:</b>
<br />
It is the root element of a WSDL 2.0 file. It usually contains a set of name space declarations which are used
throughout the WSDL file.&nbsp;
<b><br /></b>
<br />
<b>Types:</b>
<br />
The WSDL types element describes the data types used by your web service.Data types are usually specified by XML
schema.It can be described in any language as long as your web services API supports it.
<br />
<br />
<b>Binding:</b>
<br />
The WSDL binding element describes how your web service is bound to a protocol. In other words, how your web service is
accessible. To be accessible, the web service must be reachable using some network protocol. This is called "binding"
the web service to the protocol.
<br />
<br />
<b>Interface:</b>
<br />
The WSDL interface element describes the operations supported by your web service.It is similar to methods in
programming language.Client can only call one opertion per request.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<b>Service:</b>
<br />
It describes the endpoint of your web service. In other words, the address where the web service can be reached.
<br />
<br />
<b>Endpoint:</b>
<br />
The endpoint element describes the address of the web service. The
<b>endpoint binding</b>
attribute describes what binding element this endpoint uses.i.e. protocol with which you will access web service. The
<b>address attribute</b>
describes the URI at which you can access the service.
<br />
<br />
<b>Message:</b>
<br />
The message element describes the data being exchanged between the Web service providers and consumers.
<br />
<br />
Sample WSDL file:

<b>Universal Description, Discovery and Integration(UDDI)</b>
:
<br />
<br />
UDDI stands for Universal Description, Discovery and Integration.It is a directory service. Web services can register
with a UDDI and make themselves available through it for discovery
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
  <b>Web service design approaches:</b>
</h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  <b>Contract last or Bottom up approach:</b>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">When using contract last approach,you first write your java code then you create
  web service contract(WSDL) .There are various kinds of tools which can generate WSDL on the basis of java code.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  <b> </b>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  <b>Contract first or Top Down Approach :</b>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">It&nbsp; is reverse of contract first.Here you first define web service
  contract.You define all the elements of WSDL first then after that you create your java logic.</div>
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; url-pattern="/HelloWorldWS"/&gt;
&lt;/endpoints&gt;&nbsp;</pre>
          <h4 style="text-align: left;">14. What are Restful web services?</h4>
          In the web services terms, REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is a stateless client-server architecture in
          which the web services are viewed as resources and can be identified by their URIs. Web services client uses
          that URI to access the resource.<br />
          <h4 style="text-align: left;">15.What are HTTP methods that can be used with Restful web services?</h4>
          Mainly used HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT ,DELETE, HEAD and OPTIONS<br />
          <h4 style="text-align: left;">16. What is JAX-RS?</h4>
          Java API for RESTful Web Services (<b>JAX-RS</b>), is a set if APIs to develop REST service. JAX-RS is part of
          the Java EE6, and make developers to develop REST web application easily.<br />
          <div>
            <h4 style="text-align: left;">17. What are some important annotations which you use to create Restful
              web services?</h4>
          </div>
          <div>Some of important annotations which are used for creating web services are:</div>
          <b>@Path :</b>&nbsp;This is used to set path for URI at class level or method level<br /> <b>@GET,@POST,@PUT,@DELETE
            &nbsp;: </b>There are annotations corresponds to HTTP methods<br /> <b>@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_XML [,
            more-types ])</b>: @Produces defines which MIME type is delivered by a method<br /> <b>@PathParam:</b>&nbsp;Used
          to inject values from the URL into a method parameter.<br /> <b>@Consumes</b>(<b>MediaType.TEXT_XML</b>) :
          @Cosumes defines which MIME type will be consumed by the method .<br />
          <h4 style="text-align: left;">18. &nbsp;What are ways to test SOAP web services?</h4>
          <b>For testing SOAP :</b><br /> SOAPUI<br /> <b>For testing Restful web services:</b><br />
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Postman for chrome browser</li>
            <li>poster for firefox</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 style="text-align: left;">19. How to choose between REST and SOAP web services?</h4>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>If you want to implement web services in less time, go with REST</li>
            <li>If you know your client beforehand , then you can choose SOAP. If you are not aware about clients
              then go with REST.</li>
            <li>If you want to work with different format other than XML, go with REST. SOAP only supports XML
              format.</li>
          </ul>
          <div>

                    <br /> Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a standard protocol specification for message
                    exchange based on XML. Communication between the web service and client happens using XML messages.<br />
                    <!-- adsense -->
                    A simple web service architecture have two components<br />
                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                      <li>Client</li>
                      <li>Service provider</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
                      <img alt="SOAP web service tutorial" border="1" src="./images/SOAPWordPlane.jpg" title="" />
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                    </ul>
                    So as in above diagram,how client will communicate to service provider. So in order to communicate
                    client must know some information for e.g.<br />
                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                      <li>Location of webservices server</li>
                      <li>Functions available, signature and return types of function.</li>
                      <li>Communication protocol</li>
                      <li>Input output formats</li>
                    </ul>
                    Service provider will create a standard XML file which will have all above information.So If this
                    file is given to client then client will be able to access web service. This XML file is called
                    WSDL.<br />
                    <h4 style="text-align: left;">What is WSDL?</h4>
                    WSDL stands for Web Service Description Language. It is an XML file that describes<br /> the
                    technical details of how to implement a web service, more specifically the URI,<br /> port, method
                    names, arguments, and data types. Since WSDL is XML, it is both<br /> human-readable and
                    machine-consumable, which aids in the ability to call and bind to<br /> services dynamically.using
                    this WSDL file we can understand things like,<br />
                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Port / Endpoint &#8211; URL of the web service</li>
                      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Input message format</li>

                            In this post,we will see RESTful web service introduction.<br />
                            <br /> REST is an architectural style which was brought in by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his
                            doctoral thesis.<br /> <br /> In the web services terms, REpresentational State Transfer
                            (REST) is&nbsp; a stateless client-server architecture in which the web services are viewed
                            as resources and can be identified by their URIs. Web service clients that want to use these
                            resources access via globally defined set of remote methods that describe the action to be
                            performed on the resource. <br /> <br /> It consists of two components REST server which
                            provides access to the resources and a REST client which accesses and modify the REST
                            resources.<br /> <br /> In the REST architecture style, clients and servers exchange
                            representations of resources by using a standardized interface and protocol. REST isn't
                            protocol specific, but when people talk about REST they usually mean REST over HTTP.<br />
                            
                            The response from server is considered as the representation of the resources. This
                            representation can be generated from one resource or more number of resources. <br /> <br />
                            <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
                                <img border="1"
                                  src="./images/RestfuArchitecture.jpg" />
                            </div>
                            <br /> REST allows that resources have different representations, e.g.xml, json etc. The
                            rest client can ask for specific representation via the HTTP protocol. <br />
                            <h3 style="text-align: left;">HTTP methods :&nbsp;</h3>
                            RESTful web services use HTTP protocol methods for the operations they perform.Methods are:<br />
                            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                              <li><b>GET</b>:It defines a reading access of the resource without side-effects.This
                                operation is idempotent i.e.they can be applied multiple times without changing the
                                result</li>
                              <li><b>PUT</b> :&nbsp; It is generally used for updating resouce.It must also be
                                idempotent.</li>
                              <li><b>DELETE </b>: It removes the resources. The operations are idempotent i.e. they
                                can get repeated without leading to different results.</li>
                              <li><b>POST</b> :It is used for creating a new resource. It is not idempotent.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div>
                              <div style="text-align: justify;">
                                <b>Idempotent</b>&nbsp;means result of multiple successful request will not change state
                                of resource after initial application
                              </div>
                              <div style="text-align: justify;">For example :&nbsp;</div>
                              <div style="text-align: justify;">Delete is idempotent method because when you first
                                time use delete, it will delete the resource (initial application) but after that, all
                                other request will have no result because resource is already deleted.</div>
                              <div style="text-align: justify;">
                                <br />
                              </div>
                              <div style="text-align: justify;">Post is not idempotent method because when you use
                                post to create resource , it will keep creating resource for each new request, so result
                                of multiple successful request will not be same.</div>
                            </div>
                            <h3 style="text-align: left;">Features of RESTful web services:</h3>
                            <div style="text-align: left;">
                              <b>Resource identification through URI</b>:Resources are identified by their URIs
                              (typically links on internet). So, a client can directly access a RESTful Web Services
                              using the URIs of the resources (same as you put a website address in the browser&#8217;s
                              address bar and get some representation as response).<br /> <br />
                            </div>
                            <b>Uniform interface</b>: Resources are manipulated using a fixed set of four create, read,
                            update, delete operations: PUT, GET, POST, and DELETE.<br /> <br /> <b>Client-Server</b>:
                            A clear separation concerns is the reason behind this constraint. Separating concerns
                            between the Client and Server helps improve portability in the Client and Scalability of the
                            server components.<br /> <br /> <b>Stateless</b>: each request from client to server must
                            contain all the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage
                            of any stored context on the server.<br /> <br /> <b>Cache</b>: to improve network
                            efficiency responses must be capable of being labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable.<br />
                            <br /> <b>Named resources</b> - the system is comprised of resources which are named using
                            a URL.<br /> <br /> <b>Interconnected resource representations</b> - the representations
                            of the resources are interconnected using URLs, thereby enabling a client to progress from
                            one state to another.<br /> <br /> <b>Layered components</b> - intermediaries, such as
                            proxy servers, cache servers, gateways, etc, can be inserted between clients and resources
                            to support performance, security, etc.<br /> <br /> <b>Self-descriptive messages</b>:
                            Resources are decoupled from their representation so that their content can be accessed in a
                            variety of formats, such as HTML, XML, plain text, PDF, JPEG, JSON, and others.&nbsp; <br />
