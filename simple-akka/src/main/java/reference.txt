Let’s write a very simple Akka example where a “Producer” creates numbers from 1 to 10, and a “Consumer”, receives these numbers and just print them. 
The “Producer” and “Consumer” are asynchronous.


Some points to remember:

1) What is an ActorSystem in Akka? As per the ActorSystem API, it extends “ActorRefFactory“, and it is a hierarchical 
group of actors which share common configuration like dispatchers, deployments, remote capabilities and addresses. 
It is also the entry point for creating or looking up actors .

2) What is an ActorRef in Akka? As per the ActorRef API, it is an immutable and serializable handle to an actor. 
So, it is thread-safe and fully shareable. “Consumer.java” is an actor in out example.

3) What is a Props class? It is a configuration object used for creating an Actor. it is immutable, 
hence thread-safe and fully shareable.

4) What is an UntypedActor? As per the API, this class is the Java cousin to the Actor Scala interface. In other words, 
UntypedActor is simply the name for Actor but as the Java API. Subclass this abstract class to create a MDB-style untyped actor.

5) What is an Actor in Akka? Akka is based on the Actor Model, which is a higher level of abstraction for 
writing concurrent and distributed systems. It alleviates the developer from having to deal with explicit locking 
and thread management, making it easier to write correct concurrent and parallel systems.

6) What is a tell method in Akka? tell means “fire-and-forget”, e.g. send a message asynchronously and return immediately. 
The “tell” method was invoked on the ActorRef “printNumbersConsumer”.

7) “system.shutdown();” shuts down the Akka actor system.

8) In Java, if you are not inside an actor or do not want to pass the sender, use ActorRef.noSender() instead.

9) Akka can not only do inter thread processing as shown above, but also can do inter process or inter JVM with akka remoting.
